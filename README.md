This is README for Algebra seminarski rad.
Here I will record my process and this will be documentation for the chat App that is Seminarski rad.

- you need to have installed -
  _ node.js
  _ some text editor
  _ git(not nessesery but I would recomend)
  _ git bash

- 1.  setup -
  - find some place where you want to hold your project
  - create folder that will be called something in context of "chat app"
  - get in vsc, or text editor of your choosing
  - find and open folder that you have created
  - go to terminal, or node console if you prefer so
  - navigate to your folder(if you are in vsc it will do that automaticlly if you have opened that folder that you created)
  - type in **_ npx react-create-app . _** (just stuff between \*\*\*(stars), also for every other time you see this kind of writing)
    - a bit of context: - npx is one of the commands of NPM(Node Package Manager) - create-react-app is command that you call when you want to call and create everything you need to have react in that foleder - dot or spot on the end is important, that lets your npx know that it needs to create everything inside that folder that you are in
      \*\*\* if you are not in that folder that you want to create your react app, insted of dot, you should tipe down eather just a name to create new folder inside the one you already are or make a path to folder you wanna create your app in
  - wait for your app to be installed
  - go to src
  - create new folder called **_components_**
  - inside of **_components_** create new **.jsx** file and name it **_Input.jsx_**
  - and, in same folder, same type of file, create **_Messages.jsx_**
